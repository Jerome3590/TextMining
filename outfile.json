The results showed that the partial femur model was technically simpler and shortened the operative and ischemia time compared to the whole femur model.

Retro-orbital injection, although aesthetically unpleasant, can be performed rapidly without requiring mechanical restriction or heat-induced vasodilation. In addition, this technique can be easily learned by novice manipulators. This route of administration has been reported for use in bone marrow transplantation but there is no comparison of retro-orbital and tail vein injections reported for this specific purpose, although both routes have been compared for many other applications. Here, we provide for the first time a comprehensive comparison between tail vein and retro-orbital injections for two different bone marrow transplant scenarios in P3B and B6D2F1 mice. In both cases, no significant differences regarding donor engraftment were observed between mice transplanted using each of the techniques. Haematological counts and leukocyte subpopulation distribution were practically identical between both animal groups. Moreover, donor engraftment levels were less homogenous when cells were transplanted by tail vein injection, probably due to a higher risk of failure associated with this technique.

In this model, the peptide antigens Dby and Uty mediate rejection of male bone marrow transplants by female CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, and we investigated the action of nanoparticles on these T cell subsets.

Following bone marrow transplant, recovery of a normal peripheral T-cell pool depends on production of na\u00efve T cells in the thymus; however, delivery of progenitors to the thymus limits T-lineage reconstitution. Here, we examine homing of intravenously delivered progenitors to the thymus following irradiation and bone marrow reconstitution. Surprisingly, following host conditioning by irradiation, we find that homing of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors to the thymus decreases more than 10-fold relative to unirradiated mice. The reduction in thymic homing in irradiated mice is accompanied by a significant reduction in CCL25, an important chemokine ligand for thymic homing. We show that pretreatment of bone marrow progenitors with CCL25 and CCL21 corrects the defect in thymic homing after irradiation and promotes thymic reconstitution.

Previous work using a murine bone marrow transplant (BMT) model implicated increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in promoting impaired alveolar macrophage (AM) responses. However, mechanisms driving COX-2 overexpression remained elusive. Previously, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling after BMT was shown to promote hypomethylation of the COX-2 gene. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into how this occurs and show that TGF-\u03b2 induces microRNA (miR)-29b while decreasing DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b in AMs after BMT. De novo DNMT3a and DNMT3b were decreased upon transient transfection of miR-29b, resulting in decreased methylation of the COX-2 promoter and induction of COX-2. As a consequence, miR-29b-driven upregulation of COX-2 promoted AM dysfunction, and transfection of BMT AMs with a miR-29b inhibitor rescued the bacterial-killing defect. MiR-29b-mediated defects in BMT AMs were dependent on increased levels of PGE2, as miR-29b-transfected AMs treated with a novel E prostanoid receptor 2 antagonist abrogated the impaired bacterial killing. We also demonstrate that patients that have undergone HSCT exhibit increased miR-29b; thus these studies highlight miR-29b in driving defective AM responses and identify this miRNA as a potential therapeutic target."]}, {"id": "27163540", "text": ["The long-term outcome of lung transplantation is impeded by the development of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB).

Similarly, DAF knock-out mice showed greater intracellular interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production by lung CD8 T cells, and infection with MCMV further exacerbated both intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells and mortality rates post-allo-BMT.

Commonly, the donor cell contribution/engraftment is measured by antibodies to donor- specific cell surface proteins using flow cytometry. However, this method heavily depends on the specificity and the ability of the cell surface marker to differentiate donor-derived cells from recipient-originated cells, which may not be available for all mouse strains. Considering the various backgrounds of genetically modified mouse strains in the market, this cell surface/ flow cytometry-based method has significant limitations especially in mouse strains that lack well-defined surface markers to separate donor cells from congenic recipient cells.

We transplanted male donor bone marrow HSCs to lethally irradiated congenic female mice. Peripheral blood samples were collected at different time points post transplantation.

To understand how these dysregulated SR profiles might affect macrophage function, CHO cells were transfected with SR-AI/II, and phagocytosis assays revealed that SR-AI/II was important for S. aureus uptake but not for P. aeruginosa. Conversely, AMs treated in vitro with soluble MARCO exhibited similar defects in P. aeruginosa internalization as did BMT AMs. The 3'-untranslated region of SR-AI contains a putative target region for microRNA-155 (miR-155), and miR-155 expression is decreased post-BMT.

Severe combined immunodeficiency mice who received Treg cells obtained from BMC-recipients accepted skin grafts in an allo-specific manner.

Analysis of leukocyte number and blood cell type composition revealed that phage application increased the leukocyte numbers and neutrophil content in the circulating blood. Moreover, phage application led to an increased content of the myelocytic cell lineage in the bone marrow. The protective effects of phages in immunosuppressed mice are both direct (bacteriolytic) and indirect (by stimulation of myelopoiesis).

A possible strategy for selectively enhancing the graft-versus-myeloma response and possibly reducing graft-versus-host disease is to increase the migration of alloreactive T cells toward the MM-containing BM. In the present study, we characterized the BM-homing behavior of donor-derived effector T cells in a novel allo-BMT model for the treatment of MM. We observed that posttransplantation immunotherapy consisting of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and vaccination with minor histocompatibility antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) was associated with prolonged survival compared with allo-BMT with no further treatment. Moreover, CD8(+) effector T cells expressing inflammatory homing receptors, including high levels of CD44, LFA-1, and inflammatory chemokine receptors, were recruited to MM-bearing BM. This was paralleled by strongly increased expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible chemokines, including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL16, especially in mice treated with DLI plus minor histocompatibility antigen-loaded DC vaccination. Remarkably, expression of the homeostatic chemokine CXCL12 was reduced. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 induced BM endothelial cells to express high levels of the inflammatory chemokines and reduced or unaltered levels of CXCL12. Finally, presentation of CXCL9 by multiple BM endothelial cell-expressed heparan sulfate proteoglycans triggered transendothelial migration of effector T cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both post-transplantation DLI plus miHA-loaded DC vaccination and MM growth result in an increased expression of inflammatory homing receptors on donor T cells, decreased levels of the homeostatic BM-homing chemokine CXCL12, and strong induction of inflammatory chemokines in the BM. Thus, along with increasing the population of alloreactive T cells, post-transplantation immunotherapy also might contribute to a more effective graft-versus-tumor response by switching homeostatic T cell migration to inflammation-driven migration."]}, {"id": "25957389", "text": ["Mechanisms of hematopoietic reconstitution after bone marrow (BM) transplantation remain largely unknown.

Because matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) is important for macrophage infiltration and injury in other mouse models of lung disease such as emphysema, lethally conditioned MMP12(-/-) mice were used as allogeneic recipients to determine whether MMP12 plays a similar role in potentiating lung injury in IPS. Surprisingly, MMP12(-/-) mice developed IPS and exhibited an accelerated allogeneic T cell-dependent decrease in compliance compared with wild-type (WT) recipients. MMP12(-/-), but not WT, mice also had allogeneic T cell-dependent elevated lung resistance post-BMT. Recruitment of monocytes and T cells into the lungs was not altered on day 7 post-BMT, but the lungs of MMP12(-/-) recipients had increased collagen deposition, a feature normally not seen in our IPS model.

The experimental results show that high doses of splenic CD8(+) T cells mixed with T cell-depleted bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 non-tolerant (normal) donors eliminate the BCL(1) B-cell lymphoma cells and induce lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CD8(+) T cells from tolerant donors simultaneously lose both their ability to induce GVHD and their anti-tumor activity. Whole bone marrow cell transplants from normal donors eliminated BCL(1) tumor cells without inducing GVHD, and bone marrow cells from tolerant donors failed to eliminate the tumor cells. The infused BCL(1) tumor cells expressed an immunogenic tumor-specific idiotype antigen disparate from host alloantigens, indicating that recognition of the tumor-specific antigen alone was insufficient to elicit graft anti-tumor activity from unimmunized allotolerant donor splenic CD8(+) T cells or whole bone marrow cells.

The polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN; neutrophil) is the first responder to microbial invasion and acts within the innate immune system to contain and clear infections. PMNs contain, and possibly clear, infections in part by forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are extensive lattices of extracellular DNA and decondensed chromatin decorated with antimicrobial proteins and degradative enzymes, such as histones, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophil elastase. They trap and contain microbes, including bacteria and fungi, and may directly affect extracellular microbial killing. Whether or not deficient NET formation contributes to the increased risk for overwhelming infection in patients undergoing BMT remains incompletely characterized, especially in the pediatric population. We examined NET formation in vitro in PMNs isolated from 24 patients who had undergone BMT for 13 different clinical indications. For these 24 study participants, the median age was 7\u2009years. For 6 of the 24 patients, we examined NET formation by PMNs isolated from serial, peripheral blood samples drawn at three different clinical time points: pre-BMT, pre-engraftment, and post-engraftment. We found decreased NET formation by PMNs isolated from patients prior to BMT and during the pre-engraftment and post-engraftment phases, with decreased NET formation compared with healthy control PMNs detected even out to 199\u2009days after their BMT. This decrease in NET formation after BMT did not result from neutrophil developmental immaturity as we demonstrated that >80% of the PMNs tested using flow cytometry expressed both CD10 and CD16 as markers of terminal differentiation along the neutrophilic lineage.

In a mouse model achieving fully MHC-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow engraftment with minimal conditioning (3 Gy total body irradiation followed by anti-CD154 and T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow cells), CD4 T cells in the recipient are required to promote tolerance of preexisting alloreactive recipient CD8 T cells and thereby permit chimerism induction. We now demonstrate that mice devoid of CD4 T cells and NK cells reject MHC Class I-deficient and Class I/Class II-deficient marrow in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. This rejection is specific for donor alloantigens, since recipient hematopoiesis is not affected by donor marrow rejection and MHC Class I-deficient bone marrow that is syngeneic to the recipient is not rejected. Recipient CD8 T cells are activated and develop cytotoxicity against MHC Class I-deficient donor cells in association with rejection. These data implicate a novel CD8 T cell-dependent bone marrow rejection pathway, wherein recipient CD8 T cells indirectly activated by donor alloantigens promote direct killing, in a T cell receptor-independent manner, of Class I-deficient donor cells."]}, {"id": "23848026", "text": ["Transverse myelitis is an inflammatory disorder of the spinal cord that results in motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction.

In particular fibrocytes and myofibroblasts are capable of contributing to the wound healing response, including collagen deposition. In chronic injury this can lead to a pathological degree of fibrosis. Experiments have shown that this can be a relatively insignificant contribution to the scar forming population in certain organs and that the majority of the scar forming cells are intrinsic to the organ. Conversely, in certain circumstances, the circulating cells become major players in the organs fibrotic response. Whilst cell tracking experiments are relatively simple to perform, to actually determine a functional contribution to a fibrotic response more sophisticated approaches are required. This can include the use of bone marrow transplantation from recipients with collagen reporter systems which gives a read out of bone marrow derived cells that are transcriptional active for collagen production in a damaged organ. Another technique is to use bone marrow transplants from donors that have a mutation in the collagen to demonstrate a functional difference in fibrosis when bone marrow transplants performed. Recent reports have identified factors mediating recruitment of circulating fibrocytes to injured organs, such as CXCL12 and CXCL16 and shown that blocking these factors reduced fibrocyte recruitment and subsequent fibrosis. The identification of such factors may enable the development of novel therapies to block further fibrocyte engraftment and fibrosis in situations of pathological scarring.

We also evaluated the plasma concentration of hexacosanoic acid (C26:0) from X-ALD patients and correlated it with the oxidative damage parameters investigated. We observed that MDA content was significantly increased in plasma of X-ALD patients before BMT and after BMT when compared to controls, and that it was significantly reduced in plasma of X-ALD after BMT when compared to the before BMT group. These results indicate that lipid peroxidation is stimulated in X-ALD patients but there is a significant reduction of lipid peroxidation after BMT. Next, we observed a significant reduction of sulfhydryl content in plasma of X-ALD patients before BMT compared to controls indicating protein oxidative damage and that this measurement was increased in these patients after BMT as compared to before BMT. We found no significant differences in plasma carbonyl content in X-ALD patients before and after BMT as compared to controls.

Unfortunately, current reduced intensity regimens have high rates of BMT rejection. We have recently reported in a murine model that mHAs on transfused platelet products induce subsequent BMT rejection. Most nonmalignant hematological disorders require transfusion support prior to BMT and the rate of BMT rejection in humans correlates with the number of transfusions given. Herein, we perform a mechanistic analysis of platelet transfusion-induced BMT rejection and report that unlike exposure to alloantigens during transplantation, platelet transfusion primes alloimmunity but does not stimulate full effector function. Subsequent BMT is itself an additional and distinct immunizing event, which does not induce rejection without antecedent priming from transfusion. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are required for priming during platelet transfusion, but only CD8(+) T cells are required for BMT rejection.

Serum hepcidin concentrations after rhEPO treatment were analyzed in mice subjected to total body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation. C.E.R.A. administration caused long-term downregulation of serum hepcidin levels. Serum hepcidin levels in rhEPO-treated mice decreased significantly, whereas there was no change in rhCEPO-treated mice.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is an effector in the PGE(2) signaling pathway that negatively regulates alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis and bacterial killing. Therefore, examined whether overproduction of PGE(2) after BMT inhibits AM host defense by up-regulating PTEN phosphatase activity. We found that PTEN activity is elevated in BMT AMs in response to increased PGE(2) signaling and that pharmacological inhibition of PTEN activity in BMT AMs fully restores phagocytosis of serum-opsonized P. aeruginosa but only partially restores phagocytosis of nonopsonized P. aeruginosa. In wild-type mice transplanted with myeloid-specific conditional PTEN knockout (PTEN CKO) bone marrow, bacterial clearance is improved after challenge with P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Furthermore, PTEN CKO BMT AMs display improved TNF-\u03b1 production and enhanced phagocytosis and killing of serum-opsonized P. aeruginosa despite overproduction of PGE(2). However, AM phagocytosis of nonopsonized P. aeruginosa is only partially restored in the absence of PTEN after BMT. This may be related to elevated AM expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M, a molecule previously identified in the PGE(2) signaling pathway to inhibit AM phagocytosis of nonopsonized bacteria.

The evaluation of hematopoietic chimerism was based on PCR amplification of polymorphic non-coding DNA sequences--short tandem repeats (STR-PCR). The main tool was a semiquantitative method--fragment length analysis. The product of amplification was analyzed using the sequencer. The second method was based on a quantitative Real Time PCR technique (RQ-PCR) based on SYBRgreen chemistry. There were performed amplification of biallelic non-coding DNA sequences with short insertions or deletions.

This technique allows for identification of donor-derived hematopoietic cells within the recipient mice, and can be used to isolate and characterize donor cells using various biochemical techniques. BMT typically relies on myeloablative conditioning with total body irradiation to generate niche space within the BM compartment of recipient mice for donor cell engraftment. The protocol we describe here uses myelosuppressive conditioning with the chemotherapeutic agent busulfan. Unlike irradiation, which requires the use of specialized facilities, busulfan conditioning is performed using intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg busulfan until a total dose of 60-100 mg/kg has been administered. Moreover, myeloablative irradiation can have toxic side effects and requires successful engraftment of donor cells for survival of recipient mice. In contrast, busulfan conditioning using these doses is generally well tolerated and mice survive without donor cell support. Donor BM cells are isolated from the femurs and tibiae of mice ubiquitously expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and injected into the lateral tail vein of conditioned recipient mice. BM chimerism is estimated by quantifying the number of GFP+ cells within the peripheral blood following BMT. Levels of chimerism\u00a0>80% are typically observed in the peripheral blood 3-4 weeks post-transplant and remain established for at least 1 year. As with irradiation, conditioning with busulfan and BMT allows for the accumulation of donor BM-derived cells within the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in mouse models of neurodegeneration. This busulfan-mediated CNS accumulation may be more physiological than total body irradiation, as the busulfan treatment is less toxic and CNS inflammation appears to be less extensive.

Our study aimed to prove the existence of renal GvHD in a fully major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched model of BALB/c mice conditioned and transplanted according to 2 different intensity protocols. Syngeneically transplanted and untreated animals served as controls. Four weeks after transplantation, allogeneic animals developed acute GvHD that was more pronounced in the high-intensity protocol (HIP) group than in the low-intensity protocol (LIP) group. Urea and creatinine as classic serum markers of renal function could not verify renal impairment 4 weeks after BMT. Creatinine levels were even reduced as a result of catabolic metabolism and loss of muscle mass due to acute GvHD. Proteinuria, albuminuria, and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels were measured as additional renal markers before and after transplantation. Albuminuria and NAG were only significantly increased after allogeneic transplantation, correlating with disease severity between HIP and LIP animals. Histological investigations of the kidneys showed renal infiltration of T cells and macrophages with endarteriitis, interstitial nephritis, tubulitis, and glomerulitis. T cells consisted of CD4+, CD8+, and FoxP3+ cells.

In a mouse model of syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we previously reported that PGE(2) is overproduced in lungs of BMT mice, significantly impairing host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This impairment in host defense post-BMT is also marked by diminished alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and production of TNF-alpha and cysteinyl leukotrienes. However, a mechanism by which overproduction of PGE(2) suppresses pulmonary host defense post-BMT is unknown. As IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-M is a known inhibitor of MyD88-dependent IL-1R/TLR signaling and macrophage function, we sought to determine whether IRAK-M is involved in PGE(2)-induced immunosuppression post-BMT. We found that IRAK-M expression is elevated 3.5-fold in BMT AMs relative to control AMs, and this is related to AM overproduction of PGE(2). Furthermore, genetic ablation of IRAK-M in the bone marrow of BMT mice restores host defense against P. aeruginosa. Despite AM overproduction of PGE(2) and elevated E prostanoid 2 receptor expression, AM phagocytosis, killing, and production of cysteinyl leukotrienes and TNF-alpha are restored in the absence of IRAK-M post-BMT. Also, treatment with PGE(2) does not inhibit AM phagocytosis in the absence of IRAK-M. These data suggest that the absence of IRAK-M in the hematopoietic compartment post-BMT enhances pulmonary host defense and mitigates AM sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of PGE(2).

Since six of them were diagnosed with progressive GVHD at that time because there was no awareness of the existence of intestinal TMA, they received more intensive treatment for GVHD, but all died between days +49 and +253. In contrast, the remaining nine patients were recently diagnosed with intestinal TMA on the basis of colonoscopic biopsies. For eight of these patients, the immunosuppressants were reduced, and the patients' intestinal symptoms improved gradually. Six of the nine patients were still alive 12 months after the diagnosis of TMA. Our findings suggest that the gut may be a site involved in post-BMT TMA, presenting as ischemic enterocolitis.

To investigate the magnitude of toxoplasmosis after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we conducted a screening study by PCR where 21 autologous and 12 allogeneic BMT recipients were included. Peripheral blood samples were taken one week prior to BMT; thereafter, blood samples were drawn weekly for the first 6 months, and monthly up to one year after BMT. The samples were analyzed by conventional PCR and real-time PCR. T. gondii DNA was detected in peripheral blood from one patient 5 days post allogeneic BMT. There were no clinical signs of toxoplasmosis. Medical records were reviewed and showed a previously undiagnosed eye infection in another allogeneic BMT recipient. These two patients were seropositive for T. gondii. We concluded that monitoring for T. gondii DNA in peripheral blood samples using PCR might be a valuable method for identifying toxoplasma-seropositive stem cell transplant recipients."]}, {"id": "11781612", "text": ["Treatment options for patients who relapse are limited and the outcome is dismal.

These findings suggest that transplantation of BMSC-mesenchymal stem cells via IBM-BMT in conjunction with induction of HO-1 can eradicate type 2 diabetes.

Graft cellular composition included analysis of leukocyte total cell numbers, and subsets of myeloid [CD34(+), CD34(+) CD38(-)], lymphoid [CD3(+), CD3(+) CD4(+), CD3(+) CD8(+)], and activated lymphoid cells [CD3(+) CD25(+), CD3(+) CD69(+), CD3(+) HLA-DR(+)] coexpressing CD3(+). There was substantial variability in the cellular composition of BM and PBPC grafts before and after graft processing by red blood cell (RBC) removal or plasma depletion in preparation for transplant. With BM grafts, cellular composition was not associated with hematopoietic recovery, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or survival. With PBPC grafts, survival rates were higher with CD34(+)>5 x 10(6)/kg, 59% compared to 34% with CD34(+)< or =5 x 10(6)/kg at 1 year. Platelet recovery was higher with PBPC containing CD3(+) CD8(+) >8 x 10(7)/kg. Neutrophil recovery or GVHD could not be predicted by any cellular subsets of PBPC grafts.

However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Effective cross-talk between haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow microenvironment is important for normal haematopoiesis. Normal HSCs reside in a hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment that protects them from oxidative stress that would otherwise inhibit their self-renewal and results in bone marrow failure. Whether an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes PGF following allotransplant is unclear. Using a prospective case-pair study, we identified increased levels of ROS in CD34+ bone marrow cells in subjects with PGF. Elevated ROS levels was associated with an increased frequency of DNA strand breaks, apoptosis, exhaustion of quiescent CD34+ cells and defective colony-forming unit plating efficiency, particularly in the CD34+CD38- fraction. Up-regulated intracellular p53, p21, caspase-3 and caspase-9 levels (but not p38) were detected in CD34+ cells, particularly in the CD34+CD38- fraction. To further study the potential role of ROS levels in post-transplant haematopoiesis, CD34+ bone marrow cells from subjects with good graft function were treated with H2O2. This increased ROS levels resulting in defective CD34+ cells, an effect partially reversed by N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, CD34+ bone marrow cells from the donors to subjects with poor or good graft function exhibited comparable haematopoietic reconstitution capacities in the xeno-transplanted NOD-PrkdcscidIL2rgnull mice. Thus, even if the transplanted donors' bone marrow CD34+ cells are functionally normal pre-transplant, ROS-induced apoptosis may contribute to the exhaustion of CD34+ bone marrow cells in subjects with PGF following allotransplant."]}, {"id": "15077020", "text": ["In the present study we examined the effect of the timing of marrow infusion on engraftment in nonmyeloablatively conditioned mice.", "B10 mice were conditioned with decreasing doses of total body irradiation (TBI) and reconstituted with bone marrow cells (BMCs) from major histocompatibility complex-disparate donor B10.BR mice at 0 or 6 hr, or on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 with respect to TBI.", "After undergoing conditioning with 700 cGy TBI and transplantation with 15 x 10(6) BMCs, 100% of recipients engrafted if the marrow was infused between 0 and 4 days after TBI.

Chronic cervical and thoracic SCI patients (15 AIS A and 35 AIS B) treated with autologous adherent bone marrow cells combined with physical therapy showed functional improvements over patients in the control group (10 AIS A and 10 AIS B) treated with physical therapy alone, and there were no long-term cell therapy-related side effects. At 18 months posttreatment, 23 of the 50 cell therapy-treated cases (46%) showed sustained functional improvement. Compared to those patients with cervical injuries, a higher rate of functional improvement was achieved in thoracic SCI patients with shorter durations of injury and smaller cord lesions.

Our transplantation experiments using BMCs obtained from ischemic donor rats showed functional and structural recovery during the chronic stage of stroke. BMC-mediated neural proliferation was prominent in the brains of rats with chronic stroke, and most of the new cells eventually became neurons instead of astrocytes. BMC-mediated enhanced neural proliferation coincided with a significant reduction (\u223c50%) in the number of activated microglia, which is consistent with previous reports of enhanced neural proliferation being linked to microglial inactivation. Strikingly, approximately 57% of the BMCs that infiltrated the chronic ischemic brain were CD25(+) cells, suggesting that these cells may exert the beneficial effects associated with BMC transplantation. Based on the reported anti-inflammatory role of CD25(+) regulatory T-cells in acute experimental stroke, we propose a working model delineating the positive effects of BMC transplantation during the chronic phase of stroke; infiltrating BMCs (mostly CD25(+) cells) reduce activated microglia, which leads to enhanced neural proliferation and enhanced recovery from neuronal damage in this rat model of chronic stroke.

Recipients of CD11b-depleted bone marrow had significant posttransplantation expansion of donor spleen-derived CD4+ memory T cells compared with recipients of unmanipulated bone marrow. CD11b depletion enhanced the antitumor activity of the splenic donor T cells without producing significant graft-versus-host disease and resulted in long-term survival after a supralethal dose of T-cell leukemia administered after BMT. Expansion of donor spleen-derived T cells was proportional to the number of CD11b- dendritic cells in the bone marrow graft and was associated with increased levels of serum interferon-gamma. Thus, manipulating the content of donor antigen-presenting cells in allogeneic BMT is a novel strategy to activate donor memory T cells and enhance allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effects with minimal graft-versus-host disease."]}, {"id": "14716354", "text": ["Our purpose was to evaluate frequency and severity of bone mineral decrements and frequency of osteonecrosis in survivors of pediatric allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT).

This is a dynamic process, which may be complete, mixed or split between compartments and in this way, plays an increasingly important role in predicting outcome for engraftment, rejection or residual disease predicating the need for pre-emptive immunotherapy. Based on recent workshop recommendations, peripheral blood cells have been used in the short tandem repeat (STR) assay to serially characterise the haematologic course and so evaluate the usefulness of this system. Forty-six patients from a single centre were followed serially for periods ranging between 3 and 60 months. The analysis was initially performed using the Applied Biosystems Profiler Plus Kit; currently, the Promega Powerplex 16 system is used. The overlap between the two assays has allowed for continuous comparison. The initial analysis was performed at 14 days post-transplant and repeated monthly. Stored DNA from the patient and donor was used to establish the pre-transplant profile. All post-transplant analyses were performed using peripheral blood. The results obtained were expressed as a percentage of the donor profile. To illustrate the ability of this technology, three representative profiles are described. In the first, stable engraftment is confirmed at 20 months with only donor pattern present. The second is intermediate, and while the patient is clinically disease free, there exists stable mixed chimerism at about 75% of donor cells. The third patient initially engrafted but the reappearance of recipient alleles presaged a haematological relapse; the latter is an indication for salvage with donor lymphocyte infusion and here this assay will be used to show the effectiveness of the intervention.

In 1989 the Italian Bone Marrow Transplant Group (GITMO) established the IBMDR to facilitate donor search and marrow procurement for patients lacking an HLA identical sibling. By end of December 1999, 260,000 HLA-A, B typed volunteer donors had been cumulatively registered and 2,620 searches had been activated for Italian patients. At least one HLA-A, B, DRB1 matched donor was found for 54% of the patients and 696 UD BMTs were performed. In 50% of cases the donor was found in the IBMDR and in 50% in 15 other Registries. The average time from search activation to transplant was 6 months for disease other than CML. For CML it was 14 months. Actuarial 12-month transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 68% in patients grafted between 1979 and 1992 and 44% for patients grafted after 1993. Twenty-eight per cent of patients developed grade III or IV acute GvHD and 24% developed extensive chronic GvHD.

Th1 and Th17 cells were detected not only express classical cytokine IFN-\u03b3 or IL-17, but also contributed to IL-22 secretion in GVHD. Th22 cells characterized by the independent secretion of IL-22 were identified and occupied almost half percentage of IL-22-producing CD4\u207a T cells.

The BM compartment is enriched in a highly suppressive, activated/memory autophagy-dependent Treg population, which contributes to the HSC engraftment and the control of GVHD. G-CSF administration releases Treg from the BM through disruption of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis and further improves Treg survival following SCT through the induction of autophagy. However, AMD3100 is more efficacious in mobilizing these Treg highlighting the potential for optimized mobilization regimes to produce more tolerogenic grafts. Notably, the disruption of adhesive interaction between integrins and their ligands contributes to HSC mobilization and may be relevant for BM Treg. Importantly, the Tregs in the BM niche contribute to maintenance of the HSC niche and appear required for optimal control of GVHD post-transplant. Although poorly studied, the BM Treg appear phenotypically and functionally unique to Treg in the periphery.

BMT subjects had HHV-6 PCR done biweekly for 12 weeks post transplantation, while a single PCR test was done on controls. For the PCR assay, EDTA blood was collected and DNA extracted from whole blood and cell-free plasma using standard procedures. The PCR was first performed on DNA from whole blood and if a positive result was obtained, the test was repeated on the DNA from the plasma. Thirty BMT recipients (13 autologous and 17 allogeneic) were enrolled, on whom a total of 156 PCR tests were performed, while six tests were done on six healthy controls. The median age of BMT subjects was 6.2 years (range 0.5-17.5 years). The median age of the control subjects was 6.6 years (range 2-10 years). Among asymptomatic BMT patients who had PCR surveillance, the positivity rate was 3.3% (1/30) on whole blood and 0% (0/30) on plasma.

We have previously documented that among the ssAAV serotype 1 through 5 vectors, ssAAV1 vectors are more efficient in transducing primary murine HSCs, but that viral second-strand DNA synthesis continues to be a rate-limiting step. In the present studies, we evaluated the transduction efficiency of several novel serotype vectors (AAV1, AAV7, AAV8, and AAV10) and documented efficient transduction of HSCs in a murine serial bone marrow transplantation model. Self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors were found to be more efficient than ssAAV vectors, and the use of hematopoietic cell-specific enhancers/promoters, such as the human beta-globin gene DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 enhancer and promoter (HS2-betap) from the beta-globin locus control region (LCR), and the human parvovirus B19 promoter at map unit 6 (B19p6), allowed sustained transgene expression in an erythroid lineage-restricted manner in both primary and secondary transplant recipient mice. The proviral AAV genomes were stably integrated into progenitor cell chromosomal DNA, and did not lead to any overt hematological abnormalities in mice. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of the use of novel scAAV vectors for achieving high-efficiency transduction of HSCs as well as erythroid lineage-restricted expression of a therapeutic gene for the potential gene therapy of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease."]}, {"id": "23639966", "text": ["Augmentation of microchimerism in solid organ transplant recipients by donor bone marrow cells (DBMC) infusion may promote immune hyporesponsiveness and consequently improve long-term allograft survival.

This suggests that cells derived from the hematopoietic stem cell may exert an unexpectedly significant role in producing IGF-I.

Patients were randomized to receive either placebo, 2 mg/kg LSF or 3 mg/kg LSF every 6 h, beginning before conditioning and continuing to day 21 or hospital discharge. Treatment groups were balanced with respect to conditioning regimen and disease stage. However, significantly more patients in the 2 mg/kg LSF group were at high risk for RRT due to performance status >/=1, age >/=40 years, and prior exposure to CMV. Nausea and vomiting were the only adverse events observed in a higher proportion of LSF-treated patients that led to study withdrawal in six of 42 patients (14%). The times to neutrophil recovery to >/=500/microl and platelet recovery (>20 000/microl) were not improved by LSF treatment. Nevertheless, no patient who received treatment with 3 mg/kg LSF developed a documented infection between day 0 and 35 or had a serious or fatal infection between day 0 and 100 (P = 0.003 vs placebo for both).

Rather, IT transplantation resulted in the unique generation of a large population of early c-Kit(high) donor precursors within the thymus. These ZAP-70-deficient mice that received an IT transplant had a significantly increased prothymocyte niche compared with their untreated counterparts; this phenotype was associated with the generation of a medulla.

In the unrelated context, the HLA compatible donor most probably shares the same genetic history than the patient, and consequently belongs to the same population group. The study of the genetic of populations explains the difficulties in finding an unrelated compatible donor in the migrant populations, particularly those originated from Africa and from the middle east, due to their HLA specificities and to the small number of donors sharing the same origins registered on a volunteer bone marrow donors' file worldwide."]}, {"id": "12036687", "text": ["To describe a case of scleritis with choroidal detachment as the initial clinical manifestation of graft-versus-host disease after allogenic bone marrow transplantation.", "Interventional case report.", "Review of clinical records.", "A 50-year-old man developed symptoms of mild dry eye syndrome 20 days after receiving a one-antigen-mismatched allogenic bone marrow transplant.

Rapamycin and anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 negated this effect of IL-6 in vitro and prevented BM rejection in vivo. Simultaneous cotransplantation of (BALB/cxB6)F1, recipient or irradiated donor CD4 cells, or late transfer of donor CD4 cells did not lead to BM rejection, whereas cotransplantation of third party CD4 cells did. Transferred donor CD4 cells became activated, rapidly underwent apoptosis and triggered activation and proliferation of recipient T cells.

In the kidney, infiltration of donor-type leukocytes was by day 28. Mild inflammation characterized by infiltration of CD3(+) T-cells, including CD8(+) T-cells and CD4(+) T-cells, and CD68(+) macrophages to the interstitium around the small arteries was noted. During moderate to severe inflammation, these infiltrating cells expanded into the peritubular interstitium with peritubular capillaritis, tubulitis, acute glomerulitis, and endarteritis. Renal dysfunction also developed, and the serum blood urea nitrogen (33.9 \u00b1 4.7 mg/dL) and urinary N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG: 31.5 \u00b1 15.5 U/L) levels increased.

The workshop was organized in an effort to make reasonable recommendations regarding laboratory techniques, the types of specimens to be studied, and the frequency of analysis. The panel recommended the following guidelines: 1. Chimerism analysis should use sensitive, informative techniques. At present, short tandem repeats (STR) or variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis is the approach most likely to give reproducible informative data. 2. Peripheral blood cells are generally more useful than bone marrow cells for chimerism analysis. 3. Lineage-specific chimerism should be considered the assay of choice in the setting of nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning. 4. The use of T-cell depletion, nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning, or novel graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens warrants chimerism analysis at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, because interventions such as donor lymphocyte infusions may depend on chimerism status. 5. In nonmyeloablative transplantation, the early patterns of chimerism may predict either GVHD or graft loss. Therefore, more frequent (every 2-4 weeks) peripheral blood analysis may be warranted. 6.

The total thymic and splenic T cell populations were reduced until day +30. The cellular reduction correlated with the poor proliferative response of the thymic and splenic cells. A decrease occurred in IL-2 mRNA expression in thymic cells during days 15-20 post-transplant, corresponding with the low level of IL-2 secretion in the spleen and thymus of the transplanted mice. In conclusion, following semi-allogeneic BMT, there was an overall immune down-regulation in the cells, gene and protein levels.

The reasons for increasing use include proven and potential efficacy in many diseases, better understanding of the appropriate timing of transplantation and patient selection, greater availability of donors and better techniques for determining HLA match, greater ease of stem cell collection, and improved supportive care resulting in less transplant-related morbidity and mortality. About two-thirds of hematopoietic stem cell transplants use autologous cells, generally collected from peripheral blood by leukapheresis.

A CD34(+) cell dose of 3 x 10(6)/kg or more significantly influenced neutrophil (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, P =.04), monocyte (HR = 1.47, P =.02), lymphocyte (HR = 1.70, P =.003), erythrocyte (HR = 1.77, P =.0002), and platelet (HR = 1.98, P =.00008) recoveries. CD34(+) cell dose also influenced the incidence of secondary neutropenia (HR = 0.60, P =.05). Bacterial and viral infections were not influenced by CD34 cell dose, whereas it influenced the incidence of fungal infections (HR = 0.41, P =.008).

Here G-CSF treatment led to decreased BM engraftment of the uterus after injury, likely by favoring mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells over the MSCs.

Although they are generally well tolerated by patients, adverse effects may occur. It is postulated that MPA metabolites could also contribute to these adverse effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS The objective of this study was the assessment of concentrations of total MPA and its metabolites, phenyl glucuronide (MPAG), acyl glucuronide (AcMPAG) and glucoside (GluMPA), using liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in two groups: kidney transplant recipients and liver transplant patients. Associations of MPA and its metabolites with adverse effects were analyzed. RESULTS The study group consisted of 211 recipients of liver or kidney transplants who received immunosuppressive therapy, including MPA prodrugs. Multivariant analysis showed a positive influence of MPA on gastroenterotoxicity in kidney transplant recipients. In liver patients, gastroenterotoxicity was associated with lower MPAG concentrations. A positive influence of AcMPAG on bacterial infections in liver transplant patients was observed. In liver transplant recipients, a positive influence of MPA and a negative influence of GluMPA levels on the PLT count were revealed. MPA and its metabolites did not influence the hemoglobin levels in both groups. There were no significant relationships among MPA, its metabolites and WBC counts. CONCLUSIONS In kidney transplant recipients, total MPA trough concentration is associated with gastroenterotoxicity and its monitoring could have important role in management of gastrointestinal complications. The quantification of AcMPAG in liver recipients receiving MPA may be helpful in avoiding bacterial infections. GluMPA seems to have a toxic effect on thrombopoiesis."]}, {"id": "18246115", "text": ["We and others have demonstrated that the milieu created by ionizing radiation (IR) used for conditioning plays a major role in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD).

Therefore, BALB/c mice were treated with amifostine, n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) prior to transplantation with allogeneic C57Bl/6 bone marrow and spleen cells. None of 30 amifostine-pretreated mice developed weight loss or other signs of aGVHD and they rejected their allogeneic transplants. However, pretreatment to groups of five mice each with molar equivalent doses of NAC or PDTC accelerated death, and lower doses did not prevent aGVHD. In vitro tests demonstrated that PDTC and NAC acted as pro-oxidants when incubated with isolated normal mouse lymphocytes, whereas amifostine and its active metabolite WR-1065 did not. The conclusion that amifostine protected immune function from IR in vivo was further supported by the fact that amifostine and WR-1065 preserved the response of radiated normal lymphocytes to respond to PHA and both stimulated growth of non-radiated, non-PHA-treated normal lymphocytes in vitro.

To evaluate the effect of G-CSF primed bone marrow as a source of stem cells in the HLA-matched sibling transplantation, G-CSF primed with non-primed donor marrow in engraftment and incidence of GVHD for a homogenous group of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were compared. Fifty patients with CML underwent bone marrow transplant, thirty-two donors (study group) were given G-CSF 3 - 4 micro g/kg per day for seven days prior to marrow harvest and eighteen donors (control group) had marrow harvest without G-CSF stimulation.

Whereas, five of eighteen patients (27.8%) in the control group developed acute GVHD grade II - IV (P = 0.032).

Dark agouti streptozotocin diabetic recipients received DA islets to one of three sites: to the renal subcapsular, intrahepatic or bone marrow cavity site. Assessment of graft function was made by measuring blood glucose concentrations using a wireless continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM), performing a glucose tolerance test (GTT), and histological analysis. To determine if bone tissue secretes factors supportive to islet function and survival, human islets were cultured in the presence of osteoblast conditioned medium. Gene expression, insulin secretion and content were assessed in islets after culture. All transplant recipients with islets transplanted to the bone marrow cavity site had reversal of hyperglycemia and remained diabetes free until the end of the experiment at four months. Mean blood glucose concentrations, glucose variability and GTT, using CGM in recipients, yielded similar results between all transplantation sites. Histological assessments at four months after transplantation showed viable islets within the bone marrow space. Incubation of human islets in the presence of osteoblast conditioned medium resulted in positive changes in gene expression, insulin secretion and content. These positive changes were mediated by osteocalcin which was present in the conditioned medium. In summary, islets transplanted to the bone marrow cavity in diabetic rats showed good engraftment.

In a cohort continuous with the previous trial, we prospectively evaluated targeted busulfan concentrations in 32 pediatric patients (age 0.6-18.5 years) with AML (n = 6), CML (n = 6) and non-malignant disorders (n = 20) receiving HLA-closely matched donor grafts. In this trial, individual busulfan pharmacokinetics were performed prior to admission. Busulfan doses were then adjusted to achieve a Bu Css target range of 600-900 ng/ml +/- 10% depending on donor source and disease. A repeat study was done following dose 1 of the conditioning regimen. Thirty of thirty-two (94%) patients achieved target concentrations. Total busulfan doses ranged from 10.9 to 29 mg/kg. Thirty of thirty-two patients (94%) have durably engrafted. Grade 3/4 RRT occurred in seven patients (21%). Targeting Bu Css ranges of 600-900 ng/ml significantly improved our rate of successful engraftment from 74% to 94% (P = 0.043).

Although the NMDP is preparing to facilitate that number by the year 2015, there are several barriers to meeting this goal, including the need to recruit more health care personnel, including BMT physicians. To learn how best to recruit BMT physicians, we examined why practicing BMT physicians chose to enter the field and why others did not. We conducted a Web-based survey among pediatric hematology/oncology (PHO) and BMT physician providers and trainees to identify the factors influencing their decision to choose or not choose a career in BMT. Out of 259 respondents (48% male, 74% of Caucasian origin), 94 self-identified as BMT physicians, 112 as PHO physicians, and 53 as PHO trainees. The PHO and BMT providers spent an average of 53% of their time in clinical activities. More than two-thirds of PHO providers reported providing BMT services at their institutions, most commonly for inpatient coverage (73%). The proportion of providers exposed to BMT early in training was significantly higher among BMT providers compared with PHO providers (51% versus 18% in medical school [P < .0001]; 70% versus 50% during residency [P < .005]). Exposure during fellowship (94%) did not differ between the 2 groups. The decision to pursue a career in BMT was made before fellowship (medical school or residency) by 50% of the respondents. A lower proportion of BMT providers than PHO providers reported current involvement in the education of medical students and residents (76% versus 98%; P < .0001). Of the 53 trainees who responded, 64% reported not contemplating a career in BMT. Of these, 68% identified inadequate exposure to BMT before PHO fellowship as the reason behind this decision. Only 26% reported receiving exposure to the BMT field while in medical school, and 43% reported exposure during residency. The 2 most common reasons cited for choosing a career as a BMT physician were the degree of intellectual and scientific challenge (89%) and the influence of role models/mentors in the field (67%). The results of this survey suggest that early exposure to BMT during medical school and residency is associated with increased interest in pursuing a career in BMT. BMT physicians and training program directors can foster interest in the field by promoting BMT-focused education and clinical inpatient and outpatient rotations during medical school and residency.

Suitable patients would undergo autotransplant but be referred for allotransplant if they had persistent marrow involvement or an inadequate marrow/stem cell harvest. Data of all patients were recorded in a database. We reviewed this database to compare these transplant modalities with respect to overall survival, rate of relapse and treatment-related mortality. Between January 1986 and August 1997, 429 patients underwent BMT for NHL - 385 autotransplants and 44 allotransplants. Sixty-eight percent of patients received their transplant for aggressive NHL, while the others had indolent lymphoma. Three-year actuarial survival did not differ between allogeneic and autologous BMT: 71% vs 62%, respectively (P = 0.5330 by log-rank testing). Three-year actuarial rate of relapse was lower after allotransplant than autotransplant: 6% vs 41%, respectively (P = 0.0006 by log-rank testing). Treatment-related mortality was higher after allotransplant than autotransplant: 23% vs 6%, respectively (P = 0.001 by chi2 analysis). For further comparison, autotransplant patients were randomly matched 2:1 with the allotransplant patients for age +/- 5 years, disease status at BMT, disease histology, and year of BMT. In the matched comparison, survival did not differ (relative risk of death after allotransplant: 0.711 (95% CI: 0.309-1.637)). Relapse rate was significantly lower in the allotransplant group (relative risk of relapse for allotransplant: 0.190 (95% CI: 0.043-0.834)) and treatment-related mortality was not significantly different (relative risk for allotransplant: 1.425 (95% CI: 0.527-3.851)). In conclusion, a review of a provincial strategy for treatment of NHL, shows that survival is not different after allogeneic or autologous BMT, but the rate of relapse is lower after allotransplant.

BM donors were immunized with recombinant HBsAg. BM or PB cells were transplanted to HLA matched recipients. Recipients were followed for anti-HBs seroconversion. Control groups included non-immunized or rHBsAg immunized healthy adults as well as individuals that had had hepatitis B and recovered spontaneously.

Immunity to HBV was also documented in 22/35 BMT recipients (62%), who received their bone marrow from actively immunized donors. In 7/9 of these BMT recipients, anti-HBs antibodies levels were documented 25 months following BMT. In 6/8 (75%) of patients who received only PBLs from HBV immune donors, adoptive transfer of immunity to HBV, and seroconversion to HBsAg+, were documented within 2 months of i.v. injection.

Sources of marrow were autologous, isologous, and homologous (often unrelated, including cadaveric) donors. Bone marrow infusion was shown to be safe. It was also demonstrated that an aliquot of marrow, removed (harvested) from the ileum, had sufficient hematopoietic stem cells (SC) to repopulate the marrow and restore blood counts after myeloablation.

The first reported autologous peripheral blood HSC transplant was recorded in 1981 using chemotherapy 'mobilized' SC collected by leukapheresis. Mobilization is defined for these purposes to be any treatment that enhances the number of HSC in the blood such that the collection contains sufficient HSC to repopulate the marrow and restore blood counts after myeloablation. Since the early 1990s, SCT using blood-derived stem cells has become very popular and very common. The principal reason is that mobilized (whether by H growth factor or during recovery after chemotherapy) blood-derived stem cells engraft more rapidly than do marrow-derived stem cells.

Bone marrow was never harvested after either chemotherapy or growth factor (priming). It is the mobilization (most often with G-CSF alone or after chemotherapy) of BSC that produces more rapid engraftment than for steady state marrow stem cells (MSC).

The survival of patients who died from complications related to central nervous system abnormalities appears to be shorter compared to those who died from non-neurological complications. The incidence of neurologic complications appears to correlate with the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity and the risk status of the underlying disease. Nonrelapse mortality associated with reduced intensity regimens is lower compared to myeloablative conditioning regimens. However, reduced intensity regimens are still associated with significant incidence of complications, including graft-versus-host disease, opportunistic infections, organ toxicity, and neurologic complications.

However, irrespective of the use of MSC co-administration, post-transplant chimerism of BM-derived MSCs after allogeneic HSCT has been reported to remain of host origin, suggesting that the infused donor MSCs are immunologically rejected or not capable of long-term engraftment in the host microenvironment. Also, hematopoietic cell allografts currently used for HSCT do not seem to contain sufficient amount of MSCs or their precursors to reconstitute host BM microenvironment. Since the toxic conditioning employed in allo-HSCT may impair the function of host MSCs to maintain hematopoietic/regenerative stem cell niches and to provide a local immunomodulatory milieu, we propose that new directions for enhancing immunohematopoietic reconstitution and tissue repair after allogeneic HSCT include the development of strategies to support functional replenishment of residual host MSCs or to support more efficient engraftment of infused donor MSCs.

In vivo CD4 T-cell expansion was greater for young than old T-cell groups after transplantation, whereas old CD8 cells showed enhanced in vivo expansion compared with young cells. Among CD4 and CD8 cells, the T-cell receptor repertoire, surface antigen expression on activated cells, and homing receptor function were similar for all ages after expansion in vivo. The progeny of old T cells reisolated after transplantation expressed type 1 cytokines (interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) at a lower frequency than young cells and had decreased cytolytic function against H-2(k)-bearing target cells.

Administration of drugs such as cyclosporine that inhibit thymic-dependent clonal deletion disrupts the reconstitution of the immune system. In the absence of a peripheral regulatory T cells eliminated by the preparative regimen, systemic autoimmunity with pathology similar to graft-versus-host disease often develops. Moreover, the resolution of autoaggression is dependent on the reconstitution of CD4+ regulatory T cells. This study examined the specificity and function of this regulatory population assessed ex vivo that plays a critical role in down-regulating the autoreactive T lymphocyte response in cyclosporine-induced syngeneic graft-versus-host disease. The results suggest that both the antigen-specific regulatory and pathogenic effector T cells recognize a common peptide antigen framework (CLIP, a peptide derived from the invariant chain) presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Analysis of the CD4+ T-cell compartment revealed two subsets of CLIP-reactive T cells that differentially require the N- and C-terminal flanking domain of this peptide. Regulatory function is associated with the cells that require the C-terminal flanking domain. This population expresses the Foxp3 nuclear transcription factor and plays a critical role in re-establishing tolerance to self-major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. In addition to suppressing the production of type 1 cytokines, these regulatory T cells can direct the apoptotic death of the pathogenic autoreactive lymphocytes. This study also suggests that the development of functional regulatory activity is an active response initiated by the presence of autoreactive lymphocytes that can present the target antigen (major histocompatibility complex class II CLIP) to the regulatory T cells. Moreover, this process can be mimicked by peptide antigen in the absence of the pathogenic effector lymphocytes leading to the development of functional regulatory T-cell activity."]}, {"id": "24100247", "text": ["Before the availability of an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), patients were treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

Most of the cells were T-helper 2, although 10.4% +/- 1.4% were of the T-regulatory (T(reg)) phenotype, ie, CD4(+)CD25(+). Donor T(reg) cells were detected both in the thymus and spleen, thus suggesting an effect on both central and peripheral immunity. The animals with T(reg) cells had better survival (82.3% versus 47.4%; P < .01) and no GVHD (0% versus 65%; P < .001). This group alone demonstrated multilineage engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells after postnatal transplantation with megadoses of donor lin(-) BM. Both the engrafted donor CD4(+)CD25(-) and CD4(+)CD25(+) cells induced comparable in vitro suppression of T-cell proliferation, thus suggesting their role in the persistence of the donor T cells in vivo. The CD4(+)CD25(-) cells produced interleukin 10 or interleukin 4 and were inhibited by anti-T-helper 2 cytokine-neutralizing antibodies, whereas the CD4(+)CD25(+) cells showed no evidence of any involvement of a cytokine-like soluble mediator and expressed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and foxp3 constitutively. Donor mDCs and donor CD4 T cells were detected among the thymocytes of the recipients of B7.2(-/-) mDCs and lin(-) WT B6 BM.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is frequently conducted after the first HD-BU dose in order to determine necessary dose adjustments. Limitations with this method include the need for rapid determination of busulfan plasma concentration and difficulties with estimating apparent oral clearance in patients who exhibit delayed absorption of HD-BU. This pharmacokinetic study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the apparent oral clearance obtained after administering a lower (0.25 mg/kg) test dose and the traditional (1 mg/kg) first dose to predict the dose required to achieve a desired area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady-state (13th dose). In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters of test, first and 13th dose were compared to assess intrasubject variability. Twenty-nine patients received a test dose of oral busulfan (0.25 mg/kg) the day immediately prior to initiation of HD-BU. Busulfan serum concentrations were measured following the test, first and 13th doses using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The AUC and apparent oral clearance were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. Therapeutic drug monitoring following the first dose of HD-BU was conducted for clinical purposes in six patients, and dose adjustment between the first and 13th dose occurred in only two patients. The dose-corrected test dose and first dose AUC and apparent oral clearance were not bioequivalent (two one-sided t-tests, +/-20%). The first dose and 13th dose AUC and apparent oral clearance were also not bioequivalent. Six of the 29 patients receiving HD-BU dose based on weight (1 mg/kg) would have achieved a steady-state AUC of 3600-5400 ng x h/ml, a frequently used target AUC, as compared to eight and 13 patients if their dose was based on the apparent oral clearance following the test dose and first dose HD-BU, respectively. Monitoring busulfan concentrations after a test dose or a first dose provides a better estimate of the dose needed to achieve the target steady-state AUC as compared to traditional weight-based dosing. However, significant intraindividual variability exists in the apparent oral clearance of busulfan and follow-up therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended particularly if the desired target AUC range is narrow."]}, {"id": "23994289", "text": ["Hematopoiesis is regulated by the bone marrow (BM) niche microenvironment.

We hypothesized that AMD3100 enhances donor cell reconstitution in part by modulating the levels and constitution of soluble factors in the niche microenvironment. In the current study, the effects of the BM extracellular fluid (supernatant) from AMD3100-treated transplant recipient mice on colony-forming units (CFUs) were examined. A semiquantitative, mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach was used to screen for differentially expressed proteins between the BM supernatants of PBS-treated transplant mice and AMD3100-treated transplant mice. A total of 178 proteins were identified in the BM supernatants. Thioredoxin was among the 32 proteins that displayed greater than a twofold increase in spectral counts in the BM supernatant of AMD3100-treated transplant mice. We found that thioredoxin increased CFUs in a dose-dependent manner. Thioredoxin improved hematopoiesis in irradiated mice and protected mice from radiation-related death. Furthermore, ex vivo exposure to thioredoxin for 24 hours enhanced the long-term repopulation of hematopoietic stem cells. Additionally, combined posttransplant administration of thioredoxin and AMD3100 improved hematologic recovery in primary and secondary transplant recipient mice.

Such a property explains why this drug can be used as an alternative to total body irradiation in preparative regimes for BMT. However, as with radiation, BU conditioning is still troubled by severe toxicities that limit its applications to suboptimal drug doses. These problems stress the need for other BMT-conditioning drugs that are better tolerated and more selectively targeted toward normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells. We have therefore compared the effects of various novel dimethanesulfonate compounds (related to BU) in terms of their toxicity to different stem cell subsets in vivo and in vitro and their ability to provide for long-term donor bone marrow engraftment using the congenic glucose-6-phosphate isomerase type 1 marker. Introduction of a benzene or cyclohexane ring in some of these drugs affords rigidity to the molecule and restricts the spatial positioning of the alkylating groups. Among 25 different compounds thus far tested at single doses, PL63 [cis-1,2-(2-hydroxyethyl) cyclohexane dimethanesulfonate] proved to be the most effective in providing for hematopoietic engraftment. The transisomer of the same compound gave significantly less engraftment and was comparable with the effects of dimethylbusulfan and Hepsulfam. The engraftment data correlated well with the depletion of different bone marrow stem cell subsets in the host as measured using the cobblestone area forming cell assay. The extent of stem cell depletion could not be explained on the basis of the distance and orientation of the two alkylating groups. Pharmacokinetic data, however, indicate that there is a correlation between biological activity and plasma levels reached. The diverse cytotoxic effects shown by these novel analogues of BU have provided a basis for relating biological activity with pharmacokinetic properties rather than with structural properties such as distance and orientation of the two alkylating groups. The identification of highly active compounds such as PL63 offers an opportunity for further developing other closely related drugs for potential application in clinical BMT conditioning therapy."]}, {"id": "28512561", "text": ["Homing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to their microenvironment niches in the bone marrow is a complex process with a critical role in repopulation of the bone marrow after transplantation.

Recently, it has been reported that pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) also occurs after allo-BMT and often causes ALS. We sought to extract common features of ALS caused by PPFE after allo-BMT. Methods The clinical data of patients who developed ALS caused by PPFE after undergoing allo-BMT (ALS-PPFE) between April 1996 and December 2007 at our institution were collected and reviewed retrospectively. The clinical findings, radiological and pathological features and treatment outcomes of ALS-PPFE were assessed. Results Five patients who developed ALS had histologically proven PPFE (four men, one woman: median age, 37 years). The age of onset of ALS-PPFE was 13 to 109 months (median, 68.8 months) after BMT. Alkylating agents were used as conditioning chemotherapy for BMT in all patients. Only one patient developed chronic GVHD (limited type). The common radiological findings were subpleural thickening and traction bronchiectasis predominantly in the bilateral upper lung fields. The histological pulmonary specimens showed no findings of bronchiolitis obliterans or GVHD. Immunosuppressive therapy was not effective in any of the cases, and all patients died of respiratory failure with or without lung transplantation. Conclusion ALS-PPFE is an extremely late-onset noninfectious pulmonary complication of allo-BMT. This complication is progressive, resistant to immunosuppressive treatment and has a poor prognosis.

They were initially in a fibroblastic-like spindle shape and became cuboidal with the formation of nodules that were later confluent. The cells were stained to both alkaline phosphatase histochemistry and Von Kossa histochemistry, demonstrating that these cells were of osteoblastic lineage differentiating from marrow stromal cells. The mean time required for the near-confluence in the primary culture was 15 and 22.9 d in healthy donors and transplant recipients, respectively (P = 0.003). Alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly lower in the bone marrow recipients than in the healthy donors at d 7 and 10 of the secondary cultures. The period at which peak activity of alkaline phosphatase was reached was also delayed in the osteoblasts derived from BMT recipient bone marrow compared with those of healthy donors. Using Von Kossa histochemistry, much more mineralization was observed in osteoblasts of healthy donors than those of BMT recipients. After BMT, although the peripheral mononuclear cells in the recipients were of donor origin, the bone marrow stromal cells were of recipient origin according to the PCR analysis using YNZ 22 mini-satellite probe. In conclusion, the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into osteoblasts was impaired after BMT, and this might contribute to post-BMT bone loss."]}, {"id": "26725354", "text": ["A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with t(8;21) positive acute myelogenous leukemia and failed to achieve complete remission (CR) after the first induction chemotherapy.

Antihost alloreactivity was associated with reduction of posttransplant tumor burden and prolongation of survival, but posttransplant relapse commonly occurred.

We found that the infusion of MMSC halves the incidence of aGVHD and increases the overall survival of patients. Four of 39 MMSC samples were ineffective for preventing aGVHD. Analysis of individual donor characteristics (gender, age, body mass index) and the MMSC properties of these donors (growth parameters, level of expression of 30 genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation) revealed no significant difference between the MMSC that were effective or ineffective for preventing aGVHD. We used multiple logistic regression to establish a combination of features that characterize the most suitable MMSC samples for the prevention of aGVHD. A model predicting MMSC sample success for aGVHD prophylaxis was constructed. Significant model parameters were increased relative expression of the FGFR1 gene in combination with reduced expression levels of the PPARG and IGF1 genes. Depending on the chosen margin for probability of successful application of MMSC, this model correctly predicts the outcome of the use of MMSC in 82-94% of cases.

Depletion of graft T cells is an effective way of reducing the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, and a variety of methods have been used to achieve this depletion. Donor CD8+ T cells seem to be the critical effector cells; GVHD is reduced when the depletion process eliminates these cells, but not when CD4 cells are targeted alone. However, despite the successful reduction in GVHD, transplant outcomes are usually inferior with T-cell depleted transplants, because of increased graft failure, infections and relapse. Alternative approaches are needed. In vivo T-cell depletion, using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as part of the conditioning regimen, seems an attractive option. Pre-transplant ATG lingers in the bone marrow to deplete engrafting donor T cells, but also depletes host T cells to prevent graft rejection and allow de-escalation of the conditioning regimen. It also avoids the need for graft manipulation with its associated costs, need for expertise and CD34+ cell loss. The efficacy of pre-transplant horse ATG remains anecdotal but it has been reported to modestly lower GVHD in single arm studies. Rabbit ATG has been studied in prospective randomised trials. There is evidence of a dose-response effect in reducing GVHD; however, there was no improvement in outcome, because of increased mortality associated with infection. In contrast, pre-transplant alemtuzumab (campath-1H) or an earlier version of this molecule (campath-1G), which target CD52+ cells, do appear to be effective in reducing both acute and chronic GVHD. There is speculation that this is not solely due to the effect of campath on T cells but that it may also be due to the elimination of host antigen-presenting cells (APC), which seem to be important in GVHD pathogenesis. Host APC are more efficient at expressing endogenous and exogenous host antigens on class I MHC to donor CD8+ cells than donor APC, which need to cross-prime exogenous antigen. Campath-1G eliminates host dendritic cells by the time of graft infusion, supporting this as a possible mechanism of action. Pre-transplant alemtuzumab has not yet been studied in a prospective randomised study, and this is required to quantify any benefit on outcome; despite this, published studies do show cause for optimism."]}, {"id": "14723368", "text": ["We describe a case of Chryseobacterium indologenes bacteremia in a leukemia patient with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 6 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

GVHD results from a complex set of interactions between donor T cells and a variety of target tissues from the host. To gain a better understanding of the biology of the human hematopoietic system in GVHD patients, in the present study we have determined the progenitor cell content in bone marrow (BM) samples from BMT recipients, with and without GVHD, and followed their growth kinetics in Dexter-type long-term marrow cultures (LTMC). We have also assessed some aspects regarding the composition of the hematopoietic microenvironment developed in vitro. As compared to normal subjects, BMT recipients showed decreased numbers of myeloid, erythroid, and multipotent progenitor cells. Interestingly, progenitor levels were significantly lower in GVHD patients (7% of the levels in normal marrow) than in those without GVHD (44% of the levels in normal marrow). When marrow cells from BMT recipients were cultured in LTMC, hematopoiesis was sustained at lower levels and for shorter periods of time, as compared to cultures from normal subjects. The hematopoietic deficiencies observed in this in vitro system were also more pronounced in GVHD patients. In terms of the microenvironment elements, reduced numbers of fibroblastic progenitors and adherent stromal cells were observed in BMT recipients, as compared to normal subjects, who showed 7 colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F)/10(5) marrow cells and 320,000 adherent cells in LTMC. Again, GVHD patients showed more severe deficiencies (0.16 CFU-F/10(5) marrow cells and 34,000 adherent cells in LTMC) than patients without GVHD (2 CFU-F/10(5) marrow cells and 122,000 adherent cells in LTMC). Our results demonstrate that the hematopoietic system of BMT recipients is impaired, both in terms of its in vitro composition and function, and that these deficiencies are clearly more pronounced in patients with GVHD than in those without GVHD. Finally, although the evidence is still preliminary, our results also indicate that the severity of the hematopoietic alterations may be greater in acute GVHD than in chronic GVHD."]}, {"id": "10967581", "text": ["Infantile ceramidase deficiency (Farber disease) is an uncommon, progressive lysosomal storage disease characterized by multiple ceramide-containing nodules (lipogranulomata) in the subcutaneous tissue and upper aerodigestive tract, painful periarticular swelling, psychomotor retardation, and varying degrees of ocular, pulmonary or hepatic involvement. Management of Farber disease has been limited to symptomatic supportive care, and few affected infants survive beyond 5 years of age. We performed an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) from an HLA-identical heterozygous sister in a 9.5-month-old female with minimally symptomatic Farber disease who received a pre-transplant regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Ceramidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes increased from 6% before transplant to 44% (donor heterozygote level) by 6 weeks after BMT. By 2 months after transplant, the patient's subcutaneous lipogranulomata, pain on joint motion, and hoarseness had resolved. Despite modest gains in cognitive and language development, hypotonia and delayed motor skills persisted. Gradual loss of circulating donor cells with autologous hematopoietic recovery occurred; VNTR analyses showed 50% donor DNA in peripheral blood cells at 8.5 months after BMT and only 1% at 21 months after transplant. Interestingly, leukocyte ceramidase activity consistently remained in the heterozygous range despite attrition of donor cells in peripheral blood. This novel observation indicates ongoing hydrolase production by non-circulating donor cells, possibly in the mononuclear phagocytic system, and uptake by recipient leukocytes. Although lipogranulomata and hoarseness did not recur, the patient's neurological and neurocognitive status progressively declined. She died 28 months after BMT (age 37.5 months) with pulmonary insufficiency caused by recurrent aspiration pneumonias.

The median posttransplantation survival for children with pulmonary complications was 258 days, compared with 1572 days in patients without pulmonary complications. The incidence of pulmonary complications was increased in patients with allogeneic BMT (P < .01).

This anti-tumor immune response, known as the graft vs. tumor (GVT) effect, is the most effective immunotherapy treatment ever discovered. Unfortunately, the clinical application of GVT is severely limited due to the intimate association of GVT with the extremely toxic and often lethal side-effect known as graft vs. host disease (GVHD). It is a major research focus in the field of BMT to develop methods to separate the beneficial GVT effect from the detrimental GVHD toxicity. However, due to the intimate association of these effects, attempts to limit GVHD also have a tendency to limit the GVT effect. We propose a new concept for harnessing the power of the GVT effect without the toxicity of GVHD. Rather than trying to separate GVT from GVHD, we propose that these naturally coupled effects can 'mirrored' onto the host immune system and maintain their intimate association. The 'mirror' of GVHD is a host rejection of a graft (HVG). As rejection of an allograft would not be toxic, an HVG effect coupled to a host vs. tumor (HVT) effect, the 'mirror' of the GVT effect, would provide the anti-tumor effect of BMT without GVHD toxicity. In the 'mirror' setting, the HVT effect must occur against syngeneic tumors, while in the BMT setting the GVT effect occurs in the allogeneic setting. Previous attempts to elicit syngeneic anti-tumor immunity using therapeutic tumor vaccines have had disappointing results in the clinic due to the influence of tumor immunoavoidance mechanisms. We propose that the 'danger' signals that are released as a result of GVHD in the allogeneic BMT setting serve as an adjuvant to the GVT effect disabling tumor immunoavoidance. The chemotherapy/radiation conditioning prior to transplant is a required initiating event to the coupled GVT/GVHD effects. The conditioning releases 'danger' signals that mediate this adjuvant effect. To imitate this immunological event in immunocompetent, non-conditioned patients we propose that infusion of freshly activated, polyclonal CD4+ memory Th1 cells which express CD40L on the cell surface will stimulate a HVT/HVG 'mirror' effect, providing a non-toxic means to elicit the effective immune-mediated anti-tumor effect of BMT without the GVHD toxicity and without the requirement for a matched donor."]}, {"id": "9448882", "text": ["Bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation is increasingly utilised in Australia.

Mature donor T cells in the donor inoculum play a central role in mediating graft-versus-tumor (GVT) responses by destroying residual tumor cells that persist after conditioning regimens. Alloreactivity towards minor histocompatibility antigens (miHA), which are varied tissue-related self-peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on recipient cells, some of which may be shared on tumor cells, is a dominant factor for the development of GVT. Potentially, GVT can also be directed to tumor-associated antigens or tumor-specific antigens that are more specific to the tumor cells themselves. The full exploitation of allo-BMT, however, is greatly limited by the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is mediated by the donor T cell response against the miHA expressed in the recipient's cells of the intestine, skin, and liver. Because of the significance of GVT and GVHD responses in determining the clinical outcome of patients, miHA and tumor antigens have been intensively studied, and one active immunotherapeutic approach to separate these two responses has been cancer vaccination after allo-BMT. The combination of these two strategies has an advantage over vaccination of the patient without allo-BMT because his or her immune system has already been exposed and rendered unresponsive to the tumor antigens. The conditioning for allo-BMT eliminates the patient's existing immune system, including regulatory elements, and provides a more permissive environment for the newly developing donor immune compartment to selectively target the malignant cells. Utilizing recent technological advances, the identities of many human miHA and tumor antigenic peptides have been defined and are currently being evaluated in clinical and basic immunological studies for their ability to produce effective T cell responses. The first step towards this goal is the identification of targetable tumor antigens. In this review, we will highlight some of the technologies currently used to identify tumor antigens and anti-tumor T cell clones in hematological malignancies."]}, {"id": "28319075", "text": ["Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is a promising therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS), which has mainly been used in adults.

The number of donor-derived cell subsets also increased in the spleen of the recipient mice with combination treatment.

In the healthy individual these viruses cause minor, self-limiting diseases but in the immunocompromised patient they are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. The limitations of anti-viral drugs and a better understanding of the cellular immune response to viral pathogens have prompted interest in developing adoptive immunotherapy for transplant patients. Ex vivo expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for EBV have been used effectively both as prophylaxis against EBV-LPD and as treatment of established EBV+ lymphoma. To generate CTLs specific for AdV, we infected immature dendritic cells with virus, in the presence of lipid, and subsequently used these cells to stimulate PBMNCs. Cytotoxicity assays showed that the resulting CTLs specifically lysed AdV-expressing targets and that this was mediated predominantly by CD4+ T cells. To generate CTLs specific for both AdV and EBV, we developed a CD40 ligand co-culture system to infect B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) with high efficiency. PBMNCs from healthy AdV-seropositive donors were stimulated weekly with autologous AdV+-LCLs. Chromium release assays demonstrated that the resultant CTLs had specificity against both EBV and AdV and that this was mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Using mouse models of transplantation, we have observed that donor cells become \"cross-dressed\" in very high levels of recipient hematopoietic cell-derived MHC class I and II molecules following BMT. Recipient-type MHC is transiently present on donor dendritic cells (DCs) after BMT in the setting of myeloablative conditioning but is persistent after nonmyeloablative conditioning, in which recipient hematopoietic cells remain in high numbers. Despite the high level of recipient-derived alloantigen present on the surface of donor DCs, donor T cell proliferative responses are generated only in response to processed recipient alloantigen presented via the indirect pathway and not in response to cross-dressed MHC. Assays in which exogenous peptide is added to cross-dressed MHC in the presence of naive TCR transgenic T cells specific to the MHC class II-peptide combination confirm that cross-dressed APC cannot induce T cell proliferation in isolation. Despite failure to induce T cell proliferation, cross-dressing by donor DCs contributes to generation of the immunological synapse between DCs and CD4 T cells, and this is required for maximal responses induced by classical indirectly presented alloantigen. We conclude that the process of cross-dressing by donor DCs serves as an efficient alternative pathway for the acquisition of recipient alloantigen and that once acquired, this cross-dressed MHC can assist in immune synapse formation prior to the induction of full T cell proliferative responses by concurrent indirect Ag presentation."]}, {"id": "22810360", "text": ["Evaluation of potential tropic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the incorporation and differentiation of bone-marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) in a murine model of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION).", "In the first approach, small-sized subset of BMCs were isolated from GFP donors mice by counterflow centrifugal elutriation and depleted of hematopoietic lineages (Fr25lin(-)).

To translate this strategy for combined 6TG conditioning and chemoselection into a clinically feasible approach, it is necessary to develop methods for genetic modification of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to render them HPRT-deficient and thus 6TG-resistant. Here we investigated a strategy to reduce HPRT expression and thereby confer protection against 6TG myelotoxicity to primary murine BM cells by RNA interference (RNAi). Accordingly, we constructed and validated a lentiviral gene transfer vector expressing short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets the murine HPRT gene. Our results showed that lentiviral vector-mediated delivery of HPRT-targeted shRNA could achieve effective and long-term reduction of HPRT expression. Furthermore, in both an established murine cell line as well as in primary murine BM cells, lentiviral transduction with HPRT-targeted shRNA was associated with enhanced resistance to 6TG cytotoxicity in vitro.

We evaluated the risk of infection in this postengraftment period by using a well-established mouse BMT model. Seven days after syngeneic BMT, B6D2F(1) mice are no longer neutropenic, and by 3 wk, they demonstrate complete reconstitution of the peripheral blood.

This heightened susceptibility to infection was not secondary to a defect in inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung. The inability to clear P. aeruginosa in the lung correlated with reduced phagocytosis of the bacteria by alveolar macrophages (AMs), but not neutrophils, decreased production of TNF-alpha by AMs, and decreased levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following infection. Expression of the beta(2) integrins CD11a and CD11c was reduced on AMs from BMT mice compared with wild-type mice.

Seven children with a median age of 7 years received bone marrow transplantation for leukemia. All received an unrelated graft without T cell depletion. Adenovirus was sought in blood, urine and biopsy specimens using PCR and culture. Analysis of biopsy specimens included systematic immunohistochemistry. Cidofovir treatment was initiated as soon as biopsy revealed the histopathological signs of adenovirus. Cidofovir was given at 5 mg/kg once weekly for 3 weeks then every 2 weeks. Six patients had diarrhoea and one patient had cystitis. Adenovirus infection and disseminated disease were diagnosed in four cases and three cases, respectively. In six cases, serotype A31 was isolated from gastrointestinal biopsy and in two cases serotypes B2 and C6 were detected in blood and urine. Cidofovir treatment was associated with clinical improvement of diarrhoea, cystitis and fever in five patients, in whom the virus became undetectable in cultures and PCR analyses despite the persistence of immunodeficiency. The median follow-up was 360 days after BMT (240-570). One child died of invasive aspergillosis and another of disseminated adenovirus after interruption of cidofovir therapy. Further studies in immunocompromised patients will be needed to extend these promising results concerning the role of cidofovir in adenovirus infection."]}, {"id": "26676438", "text": ["evaluate the patient safety culture in the perspective of health professionals from a bone marrow transplantation unit of an oncology research center, at a reference hospital for cancer treatment in Santa Catarina, Brazil.", "a quantitative cross-sectional study that used the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire was conducted between August and September 2013.

Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats received a moderate thoracic contusion injury and were divided into three groups: operated controls (Op-Control), MSC transplant recipients (MSC), and MSC transplant recipients plus exercise (MSC+Ex). Nine days after contusion, a Vitrogen matrix +/-one million MSC was injected into the lesion site in all animals.

Passive hindlimb exercise on motorized bicycles was applied 1 h/day, 3 days/week to the MSC+Ex group. A battery of behavioral tests was performed weekly to assess motor and sensory functions in all 3 groups for 12 weeks. Morphological evaluation included MSC survival, evidence of axonal growth into grafts, phenotypic analysis of MSC, and lesion/transplant size. The weight of the medial gastrocnemius muscle, a hindlimb muscle activated during stance, was used to identify extent of atrophy. No differences in motor recovery were found among the three groups. MSC survived 3 months after transplantation, indicating that the immunosuppression treatment was successful. The extent of survival was variable, and there was no correlation between MSC survival and behavioral scores. The matrix persisted, filling the lesion cavity, and some axons grew into the lesion/matrix but to a similar extent in all groups. There was no difference in lesion/matrix size among groups, indicating no neuroprotective effect on the host provided by the treatments. Immunocytochemical analysis provided no evidence that MSC differentiated into neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes.

New approaches are required to limit memory autoimmune attack of transplanted islets or replacement \u03b2 cells. Here we show that transfer of bone marrow encoding cognate antigen directed to dendritic cells, under mild, immune-preserving conditions inactivates established memory CD8(+) T-cell populations and generates a long-lived, antigen-specific tolerogenic environment. Consequently, CD8(+) memory T cell-mediated targeting of islet-expressed antigens is prevented and islet graft rejection alleviated. The immunological mechanisms of protection are mediated through deletion and induction of unresponsiveness in targeted memory T-cell populations. The data demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell-mediated gene therapy effectively terminates antigen-specific memory T-cell responses and this can alleviate destruction of antigen-expressing islets.

In 2 aggressive metastatic models, bone marrow transplantation with donor bone marrow cells from TP-DC-immunized mice mediated a tumor-specific immune response in the recipient, and this caused regressions of preexisting tumor metastases. After vaccination with TP-DC, donors harbored increased numbers of both activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations in the bone marrow.

By using T cells derived from the bone marrow of TP-DC-vaccinated major histocompatibility complex class I and class II knockout mice, the effector cells required for the observed antitumor effect were determined to be major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8+ T cells.

The most frequent causes were acute respiratory failure (n = 15, mostly interstitial pneumopathies), septic shock (n = 5) neurological disorders (n = 5) and heart failure (n = 2). The cumulative incidence of an ICU admission at 20 months post-transplant in patients with an allogeneic BMT was 25.7% (CI: 16.4-35.1), compared with 10.8% (CI: 4.2-17.5) in those with an autologous graft (P = 0.04).

The new and intense forms of radiation generated by nuclear reactor technology, and which would be released in the event of a nuclear war, created concerns about a public-health hazard unprecedented in form and scale. Fears of inadvertent exposure to acute and potentially lethal radiation launched a search for anti-radiation therapies, out of which emerged the new technique of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study analyzes the use of BMT first as a research tool to explore the biological effects of ionizing radiation, and then as an adjunct to radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In highlighting how BMT became the province of different research and clinical constituencies, this study develops an understanding of the forces and contingencies that shaped its development. Exploring the emergence of BMT and the uses to which it was put, it reveals that BMT remained a technique in the making -- unstable and far from standardized, even as it became both a widely used research tool and rapidly made its way into the clinic. More broadly, it casts new light on one route through which the Manhattan Project influenced postwar radiobiology; it also affords new insights into one means by which radiobiology came to serve the interests of the Cold War state.

The PTH and non-PTH intervention groups included transplantation with PTH/BMSC/FG xenogeneic and BMSC/FG xenogeneic complexes, respectively, into the injured area. The injured group contained no transplant while the control group comprised rabbits without any articular injury. Samples were monitored for cartilage repair up to three months post-surgery. Immunohistochemistry as well as real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan in the repaired tissue. RESULTS At 12 weeks post-surgery, the loss of articular cartilage in the PTH group was fully repaired by hyaline tissue. Typical cartilage lacunae and intact subchondral bone were found. The boundary separating the surrounding normal cartilage tissue disappeared. The gross and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) histological ranking of the repaired tissue was significantly higher in the PTH intervention group than in the non-PTH intervention and injury groups (p<0.05) without any significant difference compared to the control group (p>0.05).

Serum samples were available for 15 patients; none had evidence of acute or active hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G and TTV virus infection at the time of diagnosis. Parvovirus B19 DNA sequences were not detectable in 10 of 12 tested cases; two positive results were detected in serum samples obtained after blood transfusion, making the analysis of these positive results difficult. All 17 patients underwent BMT. The mean post-BMT follow-up period was 38 months (range 1 day-123 months), five patients (30%) died 1 to 160 days post BMT, and 12 (70%) are alive 31 to 123 months after BMT.

Ex vivo T cell depletion has been an effective strategy to reduce GVHD but has been associated with impaired alloengraftment and host immunity. Using an MHC-mismatched murine model, we have examined an alternative approach to GVHD prevention whereby donor T cells are selectively eliminated in vivo after BMT using transgenic T cells in which a thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene is targeted to the T cell. Lethally irradiated AKR/J (H-2k) mice transplanted with TCD C57BL/6 (B6)(H-2b) bone marrow (BM) plus B6 TK+ T cells and then treated with GCV post-BMT had significantly less GVHD severity and improved immune reconstitution compared to untreated mice, providing proof of principle that this strategy could mitigate GVHD. To assess the impact of GCV administration on alloengraftment, sublethally irradiated AKR mice were transplanted with TCD B6 BM alone or admixed with limiting numbers (5 x 10(5)) of B6 TK+ T cells. When tested 3-4 weeks post-transplant, control TCD BM mice all rejected their grafts. Conversely, > 80% of GCV-treated mice had sustained donor T cell engraftment comparable to what was observed in untreated animals. Notably, GCV-treated mice were more likely to have mixed T cell chimerism early post-BMT than untreated animals, however, nearly all GCV-treated mice progressed to complete donor T cell engraftment by 2-3 months post-transplant. Preservation of engraftment was critically dependent upon the GCV administration schedule and required that GCV be delayed for at least one week post-transplant. These studies demonstrate that specific incorporation of a suicide gene into donor T cells is a viable strategy that can be employed to reduce GVHD without compromising alloengraftment."]}, {"id": "11042667", "text": ["A case of acute myelogenous leukemia with a t(8;21) translocation relapsed 5 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT).

All children in both groups had primary engraftment. There was no statistical difference in the speed of immune reconstitution or incidence of graft-versus-host disease between the 2 groups. Overall survival was significantly better in the reduced-intensity conditioning group: 31 (94%) of 33 patients survived, compared with 10 (53%) of 19 in the myeloablative conditioning group (P = .014).

Instead, reduced trabecular bone mass correlated with reduced plasma levels of amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen.

In this study, we show that CsA inhibits Treg proliferation and inducible Treg generation in allogeneic but not in syngeneic BMT when IL-2 is provided. In contrast to CsA, the mTOR inhibitor (Rapamycin) almost completely suppressed IL-2-mediated Treg proliferation. However, CsA and Rapamycin inhibited Treg proliferation to a similar extent when TCR stimulation was provided. Furthermore, Rapamycin promoted Treg expansion and inducible Treg generation in allogeneic BMT recipients treated with IL-2. Consistent with these observations, CsA abrogated while Rapamycin promoted the protective effect of IL-2 on allogeneic BMT-induced GVHD. These results suggest that while CsA permits IL-2-induced Treg proliferation in the syngeneic setting (absence of strong TCR signals), CsA in combination with IL-2 may be detrimental for Treg proliferation in an allogeneic setting.

Lumbar spine (LS) BMD was similar in groups A and B and was within normal limits. In contrast, femoral neck (FN) Z- and T-scores were significantly decreased in group B compared with group A (-0.68 +/- 0.14 vs -0.03 +/- 0.14 SD and -0.84 +/- 0.14 vs -0.22 +/- 0.14 SD, respectively; p < or = 0.002).

In the allograft transplantation model, de-endothelialized fresh aortic allografts of WKY rats were orthotopically transplanted into Lewis recipients either directly (n = 6) or after recipient bone marrow cell seeding (n = 6).

In a migration assay, active MMP-9, but not proMMP-9, increased the number of migrated Lin(-) BM cells, which was inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 or a MMP inhibitor. This chemoattractant function by MMP-9 was synergistic when cotreated with CXCL12. CXCR4 expression on Lin(-) BM cells was dose- and time-dependently increased by active MMP-9.

In in vivo studies, many EGFP(+) cells were seen in control recipient mice. In contrast, few EGFP(+) cells were observed in MMP-9 KO mice. BM cells tended to differentiate into desmin(+) cells.

Of women converted to a complete response by salvage HDC after a partial response to AFM, overall survival was similar to that in women randomized to immediate HDC.

Immediate HDC after a complete response to AFM produced some durable long-term responses in hormone-insensitive/-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Salvage HDC converted 30% of partial responders to complete responders with similar survivals.

The purpose of this investigation was to quantify CD34+ progenitor cells and to determine their dynamics during the post-transplant period. Moreover, we tried to correlate their number with corresponding changes in the amount of nucleated erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes including pro- and megakaryoblasts and the fiber content. Monitoring the quantity of precursors after BMT revealed a very rapid recovery in comparison to a control group. However, a more detailed evaluation showed that at day 22 +/- 6 a higher number of progenitor cells was significantly associated with an earlier independence for platelet transfusion and also with a more pronounced growth of erythro- and megakaryopoiesis including their precursor cells. Furthermore, a slight increase in the density of the fibrous matrix (reticulin fibers) was present in these patients that were characterized by a more favorable engraftment. The latter feature sheds some light on the complex pathomechanisms of homing and differentiation of progenitors. In confirmation with in vitro findings, this phenomenon is dependent on proper anchoring sites to the fibrous bone marrow stroma. Finally, the size of a full BM graft exerted a distinctive influence on the number of CD34+ precursors in the early post-transplant period. In conclusion, the present study has validated a number of BM features by focusing on the CD34+ progenitor cells and associated hematopoietic reconstitution including reticulin fibers and precursor cells of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage, which are not readily evaluable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis."]}, {"id": "10516701", "text": ["Bone turnover markers and bone mineral density (BMD) were studied in 25 adult patients (14 females, 11 males) who had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

Blood samples and urine collections for evaluation of biochemical factors reflecting skeletal turnover were performed together with the first BMD measurement. BMD was measured from the lumbar vertebrae (L2 to L4) with computed tomography and results were expressed as Z-scores. At the time of the first measurement five patients (20%) had Z-scores <-2.5 s.d. and 12 patients (48%) between -1 and -2.5 s.d. In 12 patients BMD assessments were repeated and it seemed that reduction in BMD had mostly occurred during and shortly after BMT and remained the same during follow-up. The cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) correlated negatively with BMD (r = -0.45, P = 0.045) as did bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP; r = -0.64, P = 0.002). No correlation between BMD and time interval from diagnosis to BMT, conditioning regimen, corticosteroid use or hospital stay during transplantation was found. In conclusion, bone disease is common after BMT. Our findings demonstrate an increased collagen and bone turnover and a high risk of osteoporosis.

Mice transplanted with ES cell-derived graft cells alone developed tumors at the grafted site and behavioral improvement ceased after day 21. In contrast, no tumor development was observed in mice cotransplanted with BMSCs, which also showed sustained behavioral improvement. In vitro results demonstrated the disappearance of SSEA-1 expression in cytochemical examinations, as well as attenuated mRNA expressions of the undifferentiated markers Oct3/4, Utf1, Nanog, Sox2, and ERas by RT-PCR in RA-treated EBs cocultured with BMSCs. In addition, MAP2-immunopositive cells appeared in the EBs cocultured with BMSCs. Furthermore, the synthesis of NGF, GDNF, and BDNF was confirmed in cultured BMSCs, while immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated the survival of BMSCs and their maintained ability of neurotrophic factor production at the grafted site for up to 5 weeks after transplantation.

One of the limiting factors is believed to be poor local survival of the injected cells, but the potential impact of apoptosis among the injected cells has yet to be assessed. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the apoptosis rate in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) prepared for cardiac therapy, and to analyze their effects in vitro on cardiomyoblast apoptosis and in vivo on cardiac function recovery following MI. Using rabbit BMMCs prepared by Ficoll gradient, apoptotic cells were detected via Annexin V (AnV) staining. The effects of depleting the apoptotic cell population by means of AnV magnetic beads was tested in vitro after coculture with cardiomyoblasts (H9c2 cells) and in vivo after cell injection into the infarcted area. Left ventricular ejection fraction and scar extent were assessed by echography and histology 2 months later. After Ficoll gradient isolation, 37.3% (33.4-37.9%) of BMMCs were found to be apoptotic (Apo(Base) BMMCs). AnV depletion decreased the proportion of apoptotic cells to 20% (17.6-32%) (Apo(Low) BMMCs). Rabbits treated in vivo with Apo(Low) BMMCs after MI presented with significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction [41.4% (41.0-43.6%) vs. 34.6% (34.6-35.9%), p = 0.03), reduced scar extent [20.4% (17.9-24.3%) vs. 25.6% (17.9-27.9%), p = 0.057], and reduced rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis compared to those treated with Apo(Base) BMMCs.

Here we report a retrospective analysis aimed at identifying risk factors for allograft rejection in the canine HSCT model. A total of 75 dog leukocyte antigen-identical sibling HSCTs were performed since 2003 on 10 different protocols. Conditioning consisted of total body irradiation at 1.0\u00a0Gy (n\u00a0=\u00a020), 2.0\u00a0Gy (n\u00a0=\u00a040), or 4.5\u00a0Gy (n\u00a0=\u00a015). Bone marrow was infused either intravenously (n\u00a0=\u00a054) or intraosseously (n\u00a0=\u00a021). Cyclosporin A alone or different combinations of cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and everolimus were used for immunosuppression. A median cell dose of 3.5 (range, 1.0 to 11.8) total nucleated cells (TNCs)/kg was infused. Cox analyses were used to assess the influence of age, weight, radiation dose, donor/recipient sex, type of immunosuppression, and cell dose (TNCs, CD34(+) cells) on allograft rejection. Initial engraftment occurred in all dogs. Forty-two dogs (56%) experienced graft rejection at median of 11\u00a0weeks (range, 6 to 56\u00a0weeks) after HSCT. Univariate analyses revealed radiation dose, type of immunosuppression, TNC dose, recipient weight, and recipient age as factors influencing long-term engraftment. In multivariate analysis, low radiation dose (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and low TNC cell count (P\u00a0=\u00a0.044) were identified as significant independent risk factors for graft rejection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell chimerism \u226530% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and granulocyte chimerism \u226570% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.023) at 4\u00a0weeks after HSCT were independent predictors of stable engraftment. In summary, these data indicate that even in low-dose total body irradiation-based regimens, the irradiation dose is important for engraftment.

Sixty-nine patients undergoing allogeneic BMT for malignant blood diseases were enrolled into the study. Forty-four (22 women, 22 men) completed 6 months, and 36 patients 1 year follow-up. They were randomized to receive either no additional treatment (n = 22), or oral calcium 1 g twice daily for 12 months (n = 12) or the same dose of calcium plus intranasal calcitonin 400 IU/day for the first month and then 200 IU/day for 11 months (n = 10). Bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and three femoral sites (femoral neck, trochanter, Ward's triangle) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Bone turnover rate was followed with markers of bone formation and resorption (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), type I procollagen carboxyterminal (PICP) and aminoterminal propeptide (PINP), serum type I collagen carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP)). Serum testosterone was assayed in men. Calcium with or without calcitonin had no effect on bone loss or bone markers; consequently the three study groups were combined. During the first 6 post-transplant months BMD decreased by 5.7% in the lumbar spine and by 6.9% to 8.7% in the three femoral sites (P < 0.0001 for all); no significant further decline occured between 6 and 12 months. Four out of 25 assessable patients experienced vertebral compression fractures. Markers of bone formation reduced: B-ALP by 20% at 3 weeks (P = 0.027), PICP by 40% (P < 0.0001) and PINP by 63% at 6 weeks (P < 0.0001), with a return to baseline by 6 months.

Coculture of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) with ECP-treated splenocytes resulted in increased interleukin (IL)-10 production after submaximal stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.

The article examines the moral basis for arguments concerning harm to the future child. It proposes that arguments concerning psychological harm may overlook or minimise the potential benefits flowing from the broader social, familial context into which the child is born. These arguments may be countered, or at least balanced, by considering the future child in this context. In relation to arguments that TT is contrary to the future child's best interests, the paper examines a non-standard consideration of best interests. It argues that this standard should be used in considering whether or not TT for bone marrow transplant is harmful to the future child, thereby extending moral consideration of interests to intra-familial interests and outcomes.

Univariate analysis showed that, among other variables (sex, age, disease status at transplant, +/- TBI in the conditioning regimen, +/- use of myeloid growth factors after BMT, time to reach PN >200/mm3), three factors were significantly associated with MTC: maximal levels of CRP during the post-transplant episode (CRPmax) (296.6 +/- 91.8 vs 88.9 +/- 55.8 mg/100 ml, P < 0.001), the use of unmanipulated graft (no T depletion) (46.9 vs 12.5%, P < 0.009) and the CRP level on the day of BMT (CRPo) (42.7 +/- 55.4 vs 18.2 +/- 19.5, P = 0.045). In multivariate analysis, using a stepwise logistic regression model including the same variables, CRPmax appeared to be the strongest independent variable (P < 0.001) and a reliable (94% accuracy) parameter to assess the risk of MTC. Based on this model, CRP levels of 200 and 300 mg/100 ml are associated with a risk of 48 and 94% of developing MTC, respectively.

HLA-A and HLA-B locus antigens were retrospectively defined by one dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the impact of frequency and estimated cell dose of CTLp and HTLp on outcome. The CTLp assay was most sensitive to HLA-A and HLA-B locus disparity detected by serology or IEF. The HTLp assay detected class I disparity but was most strongly reactive in the presence of HLA-DRB1 disparity. Univariate analysis indicated a significant association of CTLp frequency and dose with severe (grades 3-4) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and of CTLp dose with chronic GVHD. Both assays were associated with survival and neither assay was associated with relapse. After adjustment for other significant covariables including known HLA disparity, the association of CTLp with acute GVHD was lost, however, CTLp frequency and CTLp dose remained associated with survival and HTLp frequency was associated with chronic GVHD. These data support the hypothesis that post-BMT complications may be influenced not only by T cell dose but by the alloreactive potential of the cells infused. LDA of alloreactive potential was useful in detecting disparity and in predicting survival or chronic GVHD in recipients of alternative donor TCD marrow grafts."]}, {"id": "15993779", "text": ["Obliterative airway disease (OAD) development in heterotopic murine tracheal allografts, a model of obliterative bronchiolitis after lung transplantation, is immunologically mediated.

Homing and lodgement into BM of transplanted HSCs are the first critical steps in their engraftment and involve multiple interactions between HSCs and the BM microenvironment.uPAR is a three domain receptor (DIDIIDIII) which binds urokinase, vitronectin, integrins. uPAR can be cleaved and shed from the cell surface generating full-length and cleaved soluble forms (suPAR and DIIDIII-suPAR). DIIDIII-suPAR can bind fMLF receptors through the SRSRY sequence (residues 88-92).We previously reported the involvement of soluble uPAR in HSC mobilization. We now investigate its possible role in HSC homing and engraftment.We show similar levels of circulating full-length suPAR in healthy donors and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients before and after the pre-transplant conditioning regimen. By contrast, levels of circulating DIIDIII-suPAR in AML patients are higher as compared to controls and significantly decrease after the conditioning.We found that suPAR and uPAR84-95, a uPAR-derived peptide which mimics active DIIDIII-suPAR, induce a significant increase in Long Term Culture (LTC)-Initiating Cells (ICs) and in the release of clonogenic progenitors from LTCs of CD34+ HSCs. Further, suPAR increases adhesion and survival of CD34+ KG1 AML cells, whereas uPAR84-95 increases their proliferation.Thus, circulating DIIDIII-suPAR, strongly increased in HSC mobilization, is indeed down-regulated by pre-transplant conditioning, probably to favour HSC homing.

FISH preparations of the second BM sample showed cleavage and drastic reduction of telomeric DNA at the time the patient was rejecting the transplant. In contrast, the first BM sample had shown no indication of cleavage of the telomeric DNA, although the percentage of telomeric area was smaller than in the control. The replicative stress imposed on the stem cells engrafted may result in an accelerated aging effect, possibly due to the erosion of telomeric DNA.

Modifications of the stem cell graft, such as T-cell depletion, have resulted in poor rates of engraftment.

High-dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to create immunogenic tolerance by specifically killing activated mature T-cells. As a result, alloreactive T-cells in the donor graft are selectively destroyed thereby decreasing the incidence of severe GVHD. As well, host-versus-graft reactive T-cells are also selectively eliminated thereby increasing rates of engraftment. Among 210 patients with hematological malignancies receiving nonmyeloablative, HLA-haploidentical BMT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, the rate of sustained donor cell engraftment has been 87%.

The best demonstration and most direct evidence of GVL activity in humans come from the use of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). For patients who relapse with chronic myelogenous leukemia after matched sibling SCT, infusions of leukocytes collected from the original transplant donor will re-establish complete and durable remission in 60-80% of patients. DLI is less effective for more advanced phases of CML and for patients who relapse with diseases other than CML. DLI after matched sibling SCT is complicated primarily by graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), marrow aplasia, and unfortunately, relapse in some cases. There has been little information regarding the use of unrelated DLI (UDLI). Available data now shows that despite initial concerns that UDLI would result in excessive toxicity, it is an effective approach to relapse after unrelated donor marrow grafting. Response rates are similar to those seen after the use of matched sibling DLI, and many remissions remain durable. Graft-vs-host disease is a frequent complication after UDLI though the incidence and severity of GVHD is also similar to the use of matched sibling DLI. It is not clear that the GVL and GVHD effects can be separated, since the majority of responding patients also develop GVHD.

Immunohistochemical staining disclosed that the density of neurons, axons, and blood vessels in the peri-infarct region was significantly higher in BMSC-treated mice, accompanied with enhanced local blood flow recovery. Western blotting showed that BMSC treatment increased the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the peri-infarct region. Moreover, the expression of the axonal growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) was markedly increased, whereas the axonal growth inhibiting proteins ROCK II and NG2 were suppressed in the BMSC-treated brains. BMSC transplantation also promoted directional migration and survival of doublecortin (DCX)-positive neuroblasts in the peri-infarct region.

Fifty patients (aged 12-41 years) with CML were enrolled in the study. Thirty-two patients (study group) received the marrow grafts primed with G-CSF at 3 to 4 micro/kg per day for 7 days prior to the marrow harvest, and 18 patients (control group) received the marrow grafts without G-CSF priming. All patients received the same graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (cyclosporine A and methotrexate) and postgraft G-CSF treatment, 3 to 4 micro/kg daily until the absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were >10(9)/L. The primary end points were engraftment and incidence of acute GVHD. The secondary end points were the incidence of chronic GVHD, relapse, and overall disease-free survival. The study and control groups were comparable for age, sex, donor selections, conditioning regimens, and disease status. The median times to both neutrophil and platelet engraftment (ANC > 0.5 x 10(9)/L; platelets > 20 x 10(9)/L) were significantly faster in the study group than in the control group, at 15 versus 21 days (P < .001) and 17.5 versus 24 days (P < .001), respectively. G-CSF donor printing yielded significantly higher numbers of total nuclear cells in the marrow grafts compared to the numbers in the control grafts (7.2 versus 2.9 x 10(8)/kg, P < .001). Similar results were seen for CD34+ (6.1versus 2.7 x 10(6)/kg, P < .001) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) cells (68 versus 16 x 10(4)/kg, P < .001). The incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was surprisingly low in the study group: only 2 (6.3%) of 32 transplantation patients in the study group developed grade II acute GVHD, limited to the skin, whereas 5 (27.8%) of 18 patients in the control group developed grades II to IV acute GVHD (P = .032). G-CSF priming did not change the total numbers of CD3+ cells in the marrow grafts but lowered CD4+ cells and increased CD8+ cells, resulting in a significant reduction of CD4:CD8 ratio (P = .018). Six patients in the study group developed chronic GVHD either during or after cyclosporine taper. There were no significant differences in chronic GVHD (24% versus 33.3%), relapse rates (12.5% versus 11.1%), and overall survival rates (78.1% versus 66.7%, P = .32) between the study and control groups during a median follow-up period of 24 months (range, 6-50 months). There was, however, a trend in favor of improved chronic GVHD and disease-free survival in the study group.

In solid vascular organ transplantation, the donor bone marrow lineage cells can even be derived from the transplant organ, and these cells can be detected in very small numbers in the recipient. This has been called microchimerism. Much controversy has developed with respect to the function of chimeric cells in organ transplantation. One idea is that the occurrence of these donor cells found in microchimerism in the recipient are coincidental and have no long-term beneficial effect on engraftment. A second and opposing view, is that these donor cells have immunoregulatory function that affect both the acute and chronic phases of the recipient anti-donor responses. It follows that detecting quantitative changes in chimerism might serve as an indication of the donor-specific alloimmune or regulatory response that could occur in concert with or independent of other adaptive immune responses. The latter, including autoimmune native disease, need to be controlled in the transplant organ. The safety and immune tolerance potential of DBMC infusion with deceased and living donor renal transplants was evaluated in a non-randomized trial at this center and compared with non-infused controls given identical immunosuppression. Overall DBMC infusions were well tolerated by the recipients. There were no complications from the infusion(s), no episodes of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and no increase infections or other complications. In the deceased DBMC-kidney trial, actuarial graft survival at 5 years was superior especially when graft survival was censored for recipient death. Acute rejections were significant reduced in patients given two DBMC infusions, and chronic rejection was dramatically reduced in all DBMC treated patients. The most interesting finding was that the degree of microchimerism slowly increased over the years the DBMC group that had exhibited no rejection episodes. In the DBMC-living related trial, the incidence of acute rejection did not differ between groups. However, DBMC chimerism in recipient iliac crest marrow had increased more rapidly than might be predicted from results previously seen in the cadaver group, despite four times fewer DBMC infused, with the generation of T- regulartory cells in-vitro assays."]}, {"id": "20738830", "text": ["Although bacterial infection is a major cause of death even after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), little is known about the epidemiology and risk factors.

Risk factors for the emergence of HCC included FA itself, the use of androgens for a period of 3 years preceding HSCT and toxicity of the conditioning regimen. Because of the danger of developing additional HCC, liver transplantation was proposed, taking into consideration that immunosuppression would increase the risk of other malignancies.

When AAV2/5 is combined with BMT, there are sustained improvements in motor function and the median life span is increased to 123 d (range, 92-282 d) compared with 41 d in the untreated twitcher mice. Interestingly, addition of BMT virtually eliminates both the disease and AAV2/5-associated inflammatory response. These data suggest that the efficacy of AAV2/5-mediated gene therapy is limited by the associated inflammatory response and BMT synergizes with AAV2/5 by modulating inflammation."]}, {"id": "24290656", "text": ["The use of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) has achieved great outcomes in clinical practice.

The patients received standard medical therapy in the run-in phase; in the treatment phase, patients with glycated hemoglobin of 7.5-9.5% were randomly assigned into four groups and underwent BM-MNC infusion along with HOT (BM-MNC+HOT group), BM-MNC infusion (BM-MNC group), HOT (HOT group) and standard medical therapy (control group), respectively. The area under the curve of C-peptide was recorded as a primary end point. Our research is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00767260).", "A total of 80 patients completed the follow-up. At 12\u00a0months after treatment, the area under the curve of C-peptide (ng/mL per 180 min) of the BM-MNC+HOT group and the BM-MNC group were significantly improved (34.0% and 43.8% from the baseline, respectively). The changes were both significant compared with that in the control group, but no remarkable change was observed in the HOT group. Treatment-related adverse events were mild, including transient abdominal pain (n\u00a0= 5) and punctual hemorrhage (n\u00a0= 3).", "BM-MNC infusion for type 2 diabetes mellitus improves islet function and metabolic control, with mild adverse effects. HOT does not synergize with BM-MNC infusion."]}
