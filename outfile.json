The median age of the patients was 64\u00a0years (range, 32-83). Twenty-three (35.4%) patients were female, and 42 (64.6%) were male. Early/mild grade BMRF was observed in 46 (70.8%) patients and advanced grade BMRF in 19 (29.2%) patients.

These changes appeared before cartilage lesions were visible and were correlated with osteoarthritis severity. Thus the opportunity to obtain an objective assessment of bone vascularization in non-invasive conditions in humans might help better understanding osteoarthritis pathophysiology and finding new biomarkers. We hypothesized that, as in animals, DCE-MRI has the ability to identify subchondral bone marrow vascularization changes in human osteoarthritis. We performed knee MRI in 19 patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. We assessed subchondral bone marrow vascularization in medial and lateral femorotibial compartments with DCE-MRI and graded osteoarthritis lesions on MR images. Statistical analysis assessed intra- and inter-observer agreement, compared DCE-MRI values between the different subchondral zones, and sought for an influence of age, sex, body mass index, and osteoarthritis garde on these values. The intra- and inter-observer agreement for DCE-MRI values were excellent. These values were significantly higher in the femorotibial compartment the most affected by osteoarthritis, both in femur and tibia (p<0.0001) and were significantly and positively correlated with cartilage lesions (p=0.02) and bone marrow oedema grade (p<0.0001) after adjustment.
